title: "CR-4, A Remote Controlled Cleaning Robot"
excerpt: "This was my first robot which I built in 2014 after getting inspired by the Pixar Robot Wall-e to conduct trivial tasks like sweeping the floor. It is remotely controlled using a Playstation Controller. As the cleaning mechanism uses a physical brush, it consumes less power than vaccumm robots."

This robot was designed to sweep around the house to aid me in my chores. It was built during my school days in 2014. It is powered by an Arduino Mega and is controlled using a Playstation controller hacked to work with the Arduino.

* It uses a differential drive steering mechanism. Each side is powered by two 300rpm DC Motors
* Both arms has a gripper and can be controlled with the servo. 
* The head has a surviellance camera fitted with IR and LED lights to assist in night vision
* The robot has an ultrasonic sensor mounted in the front which disables movement if an obstacle is detected and gives feedback to the controller.
* The sweeping mechanism uses a brush attached to a motor, this is a power saving method compared to vacuum robots.
