abstract: "Humanoid Robots can play a major role in domestic automation. It is a platform which does not require a specific work environment and can be made adaptable. The goal of this paper is to generate stable gaits for humanoid robots using geometric methods for kinematic analysis. A 3D linear inverted pendulum model is used to find the trajectory of the center of mass. This trajectory in turn coupled with foot positions are sufficient to find a solution to the D-H matrix. A small-sized humanoid robot with 17-DOF is built and the generated gaits are tested on the robot. The robot was successfully able to walk forward, turn left and right in a stable manner."
