In this work, we present a way of performing Simultaneous Localization And Mapping on a mobile robot using an array of ultrasonic sensors as a low cost alternative to laser rangefinders(LIDAR) and RGB-D Cameras. The mobile robot captures information around it using ultrasonic sensor ring, and creates a map with position data obtained from the encoders of motors. The robot runs using ROS on a Intel NUC. The algorithm has been evaluated and tested for household environments and good mapping estimations were obtained.
