<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper presents a method for generating curved path sequences in a humanoid robot with a deficient degree of freedom (DOF).Typically robots not having the yaw DOF in their limbs cannot turn in a curved path. This paper aims at achieving that by combining the robotâ€™s friction based slip turn mechanism with the simple straight walking gait of the 3-D linear inverted pendulum model into a smooth curved motion. The amount of turn caused by the slip model is estimated and multiple experiments are conducted to verify the prediction. We noticed that the co-efficient of friction does not affect the amount of turn for symmetric gaits. A novel mathematical model which uses the radius of the curved path to plan the gait for generating a smooth circular trajectory, has been developed. A 17-DOF robot named TONY is used to test the hypothesis. The results are successful and the robot is able to walk in a curved path.
