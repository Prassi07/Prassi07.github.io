I am a Masters student at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I work with [Dr. Matthew Travers](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/matthew-j-travers/) and my work focuses on planning for hetergeneous robot fleets. My other research fields also include locomotion and control for legged robots.

Previously, I worked under [Prof. Rajasekar Mohan](https://faculty.pes.edu/p10125) in the Microsoft Innovation Lab at PES University, Bengaluru. 
 
I was also running a YouTube Channel, [All About Robots]({{site.author.youtube}}) where I used to create simple tutorial videos on Robotics and Robot Building (currently inactive).
