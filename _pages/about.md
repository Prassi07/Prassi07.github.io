I'm a Ph.D. student at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I work with [Dr. Matthew Travers](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/matthew-j-travers/){:target="_blank"}, in the [Matt Lab](https://themattlab.org){:target="_blank"} and [Biorobotics lab](https://biorobotics.org){:target="_blank"}. My current work focuses on mainly two things, 

- **Interaction-aware Motion Planning:** Developing algorithms that reason about robot-environment interactions to navigate realistic complex environments
- **Uncertainty-aware Active Perception** Developing strategies for robots to actively reduce environmental uncertainty through targeted sensing actions

I also completed my Masters in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University. Before that, I worked under [Prof. Rajasekar Mohan](https://staff.pes.edu/nm1270){:target="_blank"} in the Microsoft Innovation Lab at PES University, Bengaluru and graduated with a Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. 
 
I was also running a YouTube Channel, [All About Robots]({{site.author.youtube}}){:target="_blank"} where I used to create simple tutorial videos on Robotics and Robot Building (currently inactive). My other hobbies include cooking, playing FPS games, astronomy, video editing and mobile photography.
