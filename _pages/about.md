Welcome to my Website. I am a Robotics Researcher and my work focuses in the field of Legged Locomotion and Motion Planning. My major field of interest is in Humanoid Robots and I work on prinicples of bipedal locomotion. My other research fields also include motion planning and human-robot interaction.
