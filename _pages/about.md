I am a Robotics Masters student at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. My work focuses in the Motion Planning and Legged robot control. My major field of interest is currently in forward simulation and motion planing for heterogenous robots. My other research fields also include locomotion on legged robots. You can find me at:
