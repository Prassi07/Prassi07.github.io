     I joined the <a href="https://pes-innovation-lab.github.io/web/" rel="permalink" target="_blank">Microsoft Innovation Lab</a> (now called the PES Innovation lab) as a research intern where I worked on the Explodroid project. My key contributions to the project were,
    <h3> <a href="{{base_link}}/projects/explodroid" rel="permalink">Explodroid - SLAM Robot</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" style="font-size: small;"></i></h3>
     <ul style="margin-block-end: 0.5em">
      <li> Designing the electronics circuitry and successfully implementing odometry using wheel-encoder and Kinect RGB-D camera </li>
      <li> Successfully implement the ‘gmapping’ SLAM package to map an area </li>
      <li> Autonomously navigate the robot to a target goal point in the constructed map</li>
     </ul>  
      &ensp; After my internship, I continued working in the lab as a research-mentor. I mentored two teams working on robot manipulation and SLAM. My responsibilities as a mentor were to meet weekly and provide feedback on ideas. I helped one tema design a robot arm capable of catching projectiles. I also guided a team to expend a previous 2D SLAM approach to incorporate semantic information.
