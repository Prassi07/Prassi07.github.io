     During my final year of undergraduate study, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering under <a href="https://staff.pes.edu/nm1270" rel="permalink" target="_blank">Prof. Rajasekar Mohan</a>. I primarily worked on a humanoid robot and developed motion planning algorithms for the robot. Two papers were published based on the results of this work which primarily included,
      <h3> <a href="{{base_link}}/projects/tonyhumanoid" rel="permalink">TONY Humanoid Robot, 17 DOF small-sized humanoid platform for research</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" style="font-size: small;"></i></h3>
     <ul style="margin-block-end: 0.5em">
      <li> Computing a fast inverse kinematics solution based on geometric constraints for quasi-static balance (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9025944" rel="permalink" target="_blank">paper</a>) </li>
      <li> Implementing a turning mechanism using friction and slippage in the legs (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9382698" rel="permalink" target="_blank">paper</a>) </li>
     </ul>
      &ensp; Additionally, I also worked on developing a low-cost ultrasonic sensor array that could be used a substitute for 2D Lidars for SLAM applications.
